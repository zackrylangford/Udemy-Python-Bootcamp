What we learned Day 1

1. We learned how to use print statement for printing things to the console. This is great for sending messages to ourselves through the code to debug and to message the user in the terminal. The function is print() 

We also discussed string manipulation, such as "string concatenation" which allows you to put two strings together like this:

print("String1" + "String2")

this will output the following: String1String2


2. We talked about the \n character, which creates a new line in a print statement.

3. We learned how to take input from a user using the input function. An example would be: 

message = input("Please provide input:")

This will prompt the user to provide input and store it in the message variable. Once you have recieved the input from the user you can use it in the rest of the code because you have it stored in the message variable. 

4. Variables - We went through what a variable is and how Python uses variables. 

5. Talked about spacing and indentation in Python. It is important to make sure that your code has proper spacing or indentation because it will cause errors if you don't do it correctly.
