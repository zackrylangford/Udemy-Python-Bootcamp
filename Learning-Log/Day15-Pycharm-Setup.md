Day 15 we built a coffee machine program and installed Pycharm on our computers. This was cool because I have always though about doing this but I hadn't taken the time to try and do it, so it was pretty cool to actually work with Pycharm. I think it will add some value to my coding experience.

The coffee machine program was pretty interesting. It was a good exercise in using functions and if/else statements. I think that I am starting to get the hang of it.

I took a couple of days off because I had a lot of obligations with ministry and family that required all of my energy. I have been pushing so hard with my learning that I needed to take a break (even though playing drums, teaching sunday school and preaching the sermon are not much of a break!)

I am also coaching my youngest sons soccer team and leading youth group on Wednesday nights, which is more work. I don't know if I am going to be able to keep up with what I am trying to do with my learning. I am going to try and keep going but I may have to slow down a little bit. I am not giving up though.
