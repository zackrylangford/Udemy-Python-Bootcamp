# Turtle Graphics and GUI (Graphical User Interface) Angela Yu Python Bootcamp Day 18

## Turtle Graphics
We played around with the turtle graphics library. It's a fun way to learn about how to use loops and functions. We also learned about how to use the random module to generate random numbers.

## Tuples in Python

We then discussed tuples in Python. Tuples are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed. They are also faster than lists. We can use tuples to store data that we don't want to change. For example, we can use tuples to store RGB values for colors.

To form a tuple, we use parentheses. For example, `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`. We can also use the `tuple()` function to convert a list into a tuple.

Why do we need tuples? We can use tuples to return multiple values from a function. For example, we can use tuples to return the quotient and remainder of a division operation.

They also are immutable, so we can use them as keys in dictionaries. We can also use them as elements in sets.

Maybe if you are creating a list that you want to remain unchanged, you can use a tuple instead.
