# Debugging - Python Udemy Bootcamp with Angela Yu

## Describe the Problem

You should do your best to describe the problem you are experiencing in as much detail as possible. This will help you to avoid spending hours trying to fix a tiny problem that could have been solved in a few minutes.

The more data and clarity you can provide, the easier it will be for someone to help you and it may even help you to solve the problem yourself.

## Reproduce the Error

Once you have described the problem, you should try to reproduce it. This will help you to understand the problem better and it will also help you to find a solution.

## Play Computer

Once you have reproduced the error, you should try to play computer. This means that you should try to think like a computer and go through each line of code, one by one, to see what is happening.

## Fix the Errors

Once you have played computer, you should have a better idea of what is going wrong. Now you can try to fix the errors.

## Use Print Statements

If you are still stuck, you can use print statements to help you to understand what is happening in your code. You can print out the values of variables to see if they are what you expect them to be. You can also print out messages to see which parts of your code are being executed.

## Use a Debugger

If you are still stuck, you can use a debugger to help you to understand what is happening in your code. A debugger is a tool that allows you to step through your code line by line and see what is happening at each step. You can also use a debugger to set breakpoints in your code so that you can stop the execution of your code at a specific point and see what is happening at that point.


## Take a Break

If you are still stuck, you should take a break. Sometimes, taking a break can help you to solve a problem because it gives your brain a chance to rest and it can also help you to see things from a different perspective.

## Ask for Help

If you are still stuck, you should ask for help. You can ask for help on the internet or you can ask for help from a friend or colleague. Asking for help can help you to solve a problem because it gives you a fresh perspective and it can also help you to see things from a different perspective.

## Run often

You should run your code often to make sure that it is working as expected. This will help you to avoid spending hours trying to fix a tiny problem that could have been solved in a few minutes.

## Search Stack Overflow

You should search Stack Overflow to see if anyone else has had the same problem as you. This will help you to avoid spending hours trying to fix a tiny problem that could have been solved in a few minutes.
