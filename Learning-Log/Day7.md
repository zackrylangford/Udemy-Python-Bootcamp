## Worked on a hangman game

### Diagram the flowchart for the game

We first used draw.io to diagram out the logic for the game so we could see what all we needed to do in order to make the game work. We then used the flowchart to write out the code for the game.

### Worked on part one, which was selected a random word from a list of words

We first created a list of words that we wanted to use for the game. We then imported the random module and used the random.choice() function to select a random word from the list of words. We then printed the word to make sure it was working correctly.

### We then prompted the user to guess a letter

We used the input() function to prompt the user to guess a letter. We then printed the letter to make sure it was working correctly.

### We then checked to see if the letter was in the word
We used a for loop to loop through the word and check to see if the letter was in the word. We then printed the letter to make sure it was working correctly.

### We then created an empty list to display the number of blanks in the word

We used a for loop to loop through the word and add a blank for each letter in the word. We then printed the list to make sure it was working correctly.

### We then swapped out the correct letter for the blank if the user guessed the correct letter

We used a for loop to loop through the word and check to see if the letter was in the word. If the letter was in the word, we swapped out the blank for the correct letter. We then printed the list to make sure it was working correctly.

### We then completed the rest of the game using various loops and if statements

### Setting a game over flag

We set a game over flag to False so that we could use it to end the game if the user guessed the word correctly or ran out of guesses.

### including ASCII art in Python Terminal program

We found some ASCII art online and copied it into our program. We then printed the art to make sure it was working correctly.
