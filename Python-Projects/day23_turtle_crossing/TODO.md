- [ ] Create a screen
- [ ] Create a settings page to define all of the game settings
- [ ] Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the "Up" keypress to move the turtle north.
- [ ] Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen (think of it as a safe zone for our little turtle).
- [ ] Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens.
- [ ] Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached the FINISH_LINE_Y). When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars. Hint: think about creating an attribute and using the MOVE_INCREMENT to increase the car speed.
- [ ] Create a scoreboard that keeps track of which level the user is on. Every time the turtle player does a successful crossing, the level should increase. When the turtle hits a car, GAME OVER should be displayed in the centre.
